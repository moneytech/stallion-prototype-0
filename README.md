# stallion
Basic kernel in C. Eventually will be a basis for unikernels.

## Goals
The main goal for this project was really just to get some
semblance of a working operating system.

It would truly be a fool's errand to try to compete with Windows,
Linux, MacOS, etc., so that's not really a possibility I've considered.

Where there is still room for innovation, however, is containerization
and process isolation. Stallion could potentially fill a niche as a
POSIX-compatible environment for running single programs.
